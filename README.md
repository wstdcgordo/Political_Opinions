# Classifying Political Spectrum through Opinions

---

This project focuses on using the classification method in machine learning to predict the political sides of participants based on stances on local issues and other important factors.
My interest in analyzing and exploring the issues of elections, socio-economics, and global politics has brought me to do this project.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle. The data's contents are in Turkish, and translation into other languages can be possible.

## Objectives
The following are the objectives for the project:
1. Determine the composition of the data (i.e., number and/or share of participants based on age, sex, residency, educational background, and the political views [represented as political parties] the participants are aligned)
2. Determine the percentage/share of participants' opinions on each political issue asked.
3. Compare different machine learning classification models and obtain their accuracies and other relevant metrics.
4. Classify the political views of participants of which the political views were listed as 'Others'

## Limitations
The dataset is hugely imbalanced; while removing the participants with views tagged as 'Others,' the participants having conservative views outnumber those with liberal/progressive ones by a ratio of 3:2.
